# Me In Markdown
## Introduction
Hi! My name is Sophie Enriquez, I'm 15 years old and I am a sophomore. 

My favorite books are all the Percy Jackson series. I find them really interesting and are some of the few fantasy books that I enjoy reading. My favorite movie is "How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days."I love rom-coms in general, but that one is my absolute favorite and I watch it all the time as a comfort movie. Some unique facts about me is that I was born in San Diego, and my first language was spanish. My favorite food is pasta. I love pasta because it comes in many different sauces and different types of shapes and it is so delicious. These are a few of my favorite things and what makes me, me.

This summer I learned a lot of different skills and new things. This includes, learning how to cook a new dish. The new dish I learned to cook was enchiladas which is something commonly consumed in my culture. I was also able to complete 40 hours of volunteering. I volunteer at my local church, Shepherd Church. I've been attending this church for over 4 years, and I volunteer in the children's ministry taking care of little kids.
