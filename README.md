# Me In Markdown
## Introduction
Hi! My name is Sophie Enriquez, I'm 15 years old and I am a sophomore. 

My favorite books are all the Percy Jackson series. I find them really interesting and are some of the few fantasy books that I enjoy reading. My favorite movie is "How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days."I love rom-coms in general, but that one is my absolute favorite and I watch it all the time as a comfort movie. Some unique facts about me is that I was born in San Diego, and my first language was spanish. My favorite food is pasta. I love pasta because it comes in many different sauces and different types of shapes and it is so delicious. These are a few of my favorite things and what makes me, me.

This summer I learned a lot of different skills and new things. This includes, learning how to cook a new dish. The new dish I learned to cook was enchiladas which is something commonly consumed in my culture. I was also able to complete 40 hours of volunteering. I volunteer at my local church, Shepherd Church. I've been attending this church for over 4 years, and I volunteer in the children's ministry taking care of little kids. Some things that I've also been a part of is sports. I've done dance, soccer, basketball, swim, and more.

Some goals I hope to achieve this year are getting straight A's, getting a 3 or higher on my AP exams, and joining various clubs. I hope to enhance my learning in code this year and learn how to use it for personal things. This includes making websites, or creating games. My experiences in classes this year have been helpingme learn more  about what I would like to achieve in the future with college. I plan to either study child services or law.
